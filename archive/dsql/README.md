# DSQL Implementation Archive

This directory contains the archived DSQL implementation that was causing connection issues.

## Files:
- `init-database.ts`: Database initialization Lambda function for DSQL
- `user-repository.ts`: DSQL-based user repository (if it exists)

## Issue Summary:
The DSQL implementation was encountering "access denied" errors despite:
- Proper IAM permissions (dsql:DbConnect, dsql:DbConnectAdmin)
- Correct auth token generation (1300+ character tokens)
- Valid cluster ARN and endpoint connection
- Both regular and admin auth token attempts

## Next Steps:
- Switched to DynamoDB for immediate functionality
- Can revisit DSQL once core functionality is working
- May need to investigate DSQL-specific authentication requirements
