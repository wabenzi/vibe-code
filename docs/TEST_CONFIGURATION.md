# Test Configuration Summary

## 🎯 Quick Test Commands

### Default Testing
```bash
npm test                 # ✅ Unit tests only (fast, reliable)
```

### AWS-Specific Testing
```bash
npm run test:aws         # 🌐 AWS/Production API tests (requires deployed API)
```

## Complete Test Suite

| Command | Purpose | Dependencies | Success Rate | Duration |
|---------|---------|--------------|--------------|----------|
| `npm test` | **Unit tests only** | None | ✅ 100% (260/260 tests) | ~8s |
| `npm run test:unit` | Unit tests (explicit) | None | ✅ 100% (260/260 tests) | ~8s |
| `npm run test:aws` | **AWS API tests** | Deployed API + API_BASE_URL | ✅ 100% (8/8 tests) | ~6s |
| `npm run test:integration` | Integration tests | LocalStack environment | ⚠️ Requires LocalStack | ~90s |
| `npm run test:contract` | Contract tests | None - uses Pact mocks | ✅ 100% (5/5 tests) | ~2s |
| `npm run test:behavioral` | Behavioral tests | Cucumber.js | ✅ Available | Variable |
| `npm run test:api` | All API tests | API environment | Varies by environment | Variable |
| `npm run test:ci` | CI pipeline tests | Full coverage report | ✅ Comprehensive | ~15s |

## 📊 Test Results Summary

### ✅ Unit Tests (npm test)
- **23/23 test suites** passing
- **260/260 tests** passing  
- **100% success rate**
- **No external dependencies**
- **Fast feedback loop for development**

### ✅ AWS Tests (npm run test:aws)
- **8/8 API tests** passing when deployed
- **Production environment validation**
- **Full CRUD operations testing**
- **JWT authentication verification**
- **Real DynamoDB operations**

## 🔧 Environment Setup for AWS Tests

### Automatic Setup (Recommended)
```bash
# Deploy and test in one command
npm run deploy:prod:test         # Automatically sets API_BASE_URL and runs tests
```

### Manual Setup
```bash
# Set the API URL manually
export API_BASE_URL="https://your-api-url.execute-api.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/prod/"

# Run AWS tests
npm run test:aws
```

## 💡 Best Practices

### Development Workflow
1. **Primary**: Use `npm test` for rapid feedback during coding
2. **Verification**: Use `npm run test:aws` after deployment to verify live API
3. **CI/CD**: Use `npm run test:ci` for comprehensive coverage reporting
4. **Manual Testing**: Use `node generate-test-token.js` to create JWT tokens

### Test Strategy
- **Unit Tests**: Run continuously during development (no setup required)
- **AWS Tests**: Run after deployment to verify production readiness
- **Integration Tests**: Run when testing LocalStack environment
- **Contract Tests**: Run to verify API contracts without external dependencies

## 🚀 Deployment + Testing Integration

The deploy scripts automatically configure and run tests:

```bash
# Production deployment with automatic testing
npm run deploy:prod:test

# Staging deployment with automatic testing  
npm run deploy:staging:test

# Manual testing after deployment
npm run test:aws
```

## 🔍 Test Coverage

- **Statement Coverage**: 100%
- **Branch Coverage**: 96.15%
- **Test-to-Source Ratio**: 7.6:1
- **Total Test Files**: 29 across multiple categories

This configuration ensures reliable, fast feedback during development while providing comprehensive verification of deployed systems.
